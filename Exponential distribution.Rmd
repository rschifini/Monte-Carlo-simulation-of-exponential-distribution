# Monte Carlo simulation of the Exponential Distribution

## Parameters

`R` is the average rate of the events
`t` is the simulation's total time

```{r}
R = 5
t = 1000000
```

## Events

The events are simulated by a uniform random distribution between 0 and `t`.

```{r}
events = runif(R*t ,0, t)
```

Since the exponential distribution is about the time between events, we need to sort the events and then calculate the time between events.

```{r}
t_events = diff(sort(events))

```

## Graphs

```{r}
x = sort(t_events)
y = (1:length(t_events))/length(t_events)
sel = seq(from=1, along.with = x, by = 100)

plot(x[sel], y[sel], type = "l")

z = rexp(t, R)

xe = sort(z)
ye = (1:length(z))/length(z)
sel = seq(from=1, along.with = xe, by = 100)

points(xe[sel], ye[sel], col='red')

```
