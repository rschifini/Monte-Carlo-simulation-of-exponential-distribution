# Monte Carlo Simulation of the Exponential Distribution

## The Exponential Distribution

The exponential distribution is used to describe the time between independent events that happen at an average rate.

This distribution can be easily deduced analitycaly, but it can be also simulated by using an uniform probability distribution.

## Simulating the Exponential Distribution

Independent events that happen at an average rate can be simulated with the Monte Carlo method and a uniform distribution.

Events that happen at an average rate of R events/time_unit can be simulated by a total of T * R events, where T is the total time units.

## Files

A Jupyter Notebook shows how to create a Monte Carlo simulation that generates an Exponential probability distribution from a uniform probability distribution.

An R Markdown file is also available.
